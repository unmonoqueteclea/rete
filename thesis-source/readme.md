## why write my thesis in Markdown?

Markdown is a super-friendly plain text format that can be easily
converted to a bunch of other formats like PDF, Word and LaTeX. You'll
enjoy working in Markdown because:

- it is a clean, plain-text format...
- ...but you can use LaTeX when you need it (for example, in laying out mathematical formula).
- it doesn't suffer from the freezes and crashes that some of us experience when working with large, image-heavy Word documents.
- it automatically handles the table of contents, bibliography etc with Pandoc.
- comments, drafts of text, etc can be added to the document by wrapping them in &lt;!--  --&gt;
- it works well with Git, so keeping backups is straightforward. Just commit the changes and then push them to your repository.
- there is no lock-in. If you decide that Markdown isn't for you, then just output to Word, or whatever, and continue working in the new format.
